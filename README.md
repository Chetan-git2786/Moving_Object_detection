This project was done  as part of the Internship  at Pantech Solutions  
In this project the python code was written making use of the Open CV library to detect the real time object detection. 

Moving object detection is a technique used in computer vision and image processing. Multiple consecutive frames from a video are compared by various methods to determine if any moving object is detected.
